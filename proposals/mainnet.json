    "description": "The current collateral requirements are 20% LTV (loan to value)to earn rewards, and 25% LTV to borrow the maximum amount. Letâ€™s increase the LTV to 35% for rewards and borrowing, so you can earn and borrow more against your collateral. Increased capital efficiency (how much you can borrow given a certain amount of collateral) will make Balanced more attractive to borrowers, and increase origination fees. This should also spur more originations of bnUSD in the short term.",

    "description": "When you borrow Balanced Dollars, you pay a 1% origination fee. The implied annual interest rate (1%) is still only half that of other platforms. A small increase to 1.15% will create more income for Balanced and BALN holders, while limiting the inconvenience to borrowers.",
