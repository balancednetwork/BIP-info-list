    "description": "The current collateral requirements are 20% LTV (loan to value)to earn rewards, and 25% LTV to borrow the maximum amount. Letâ€™s increase the LTV to 35% for rewards and borrowing, so you can earn and borrow more against your collateral. Increased capital efficiency (how much you can borrow given a certain amount of collateral) will make Balanced more attractive to borrowers, and increase origination fees. This should also spur more originations of bnUSD in the short term.",
